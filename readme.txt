* Select the type of animation for that group of items (over 70 types, based on the popular CSS library animate.css).
* Option to select the duration of the animation (0.5 - 5 sec; with increments of 0.1 sec).
* Option to select the repetition of the animation (1 - 5 times; Infinite is also an option).
